Meteor Chat with Rooms
-----------

Chat application with added functionality of Rooms.
Currently limited to showing the last 5 rooms

Additional Functionality:
Users must enter a name before joining a room
Room listing shows number of current participants
Rooms now list participants. When participants leave a room by clicking leave room, they are removed from the list. Otherwise, they still appear for now.

Future planned functionality:
Messaging a user directly by clicking the participant name
Suggestions welcome!

Thanks to Tom Blomfield as the code for the chat functionality with some modifications is pulled from his sample chat application.
